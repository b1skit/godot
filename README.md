#### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine used to create 2D
and 3D games from a unified interface. Godot provides a comprehensive set of
common tools that allow users to focus on making games without having to
reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms,
including the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as 
mobile (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.

#### Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Godot users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, and supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy. Users are
empowered to help shape the engine to match their expectations.

Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan
Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

### Getting the engine

#### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and export templates can be found
[on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/download).

#### Compiling Godot from source

[See the official docs](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

### Community

Godot is not only an engine, but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the Godot developers is to join the
[#godotengine IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=godotengine)
on Freenode.

### Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://docs.godotengine.org).
It is maintained by the Godot community on its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).

The [class reference](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)
is also accessible from within the engine.

The official Godot demos are maintained in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects).

There are also a number of learning resources provided by the community,
such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc. Consult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)
